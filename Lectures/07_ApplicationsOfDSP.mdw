# Applications of Digital Signal Processing

### Applications of Digital Signal Processing

* Signal filtering (e.g. images)
    * denoising (remove noise)
    * inpainting (fill in missing parts)
    * improve quality
    
* Control theory
    * e.g. controlling a motor to a target speed profile, in various conditions
        * PID controller

* Convolutional neural networks
