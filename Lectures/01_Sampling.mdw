# Sampling of Analog Signals


## Signals

- Signal = a measurable quantity which varies in time, space or some other variable

- Example: a voltage signal

- Represented as a mathematical function, e.g. $v(t)$.

- **Off Topic: Glossary**
   - "e.g." = "*exampli gratia*" (lat.) = "for example" (eng.) = "de exemplu" (rom.)
   - "i.e." = "*id est*" (lat) = "that is" (eng.) = "adicÄƒ" (rom.)


## Signal dimension

- Unidimensional (1D) signal: = a function of a signal variable
   - Example: $v(t)$ = a function of time

- Multidimensional (2D, 3D, ...) signal = a function of multiple variables
   - Example: intensity of an image across a photo, $I(x,y)$, depends on the two
   coordinates $x$ and $y$ that specify the position

## Continuous and discrete signals

- Continuous (analog) signal = function of a continuous variable
   - Signal has a value for possible value of the variable in the defined range
   - The variable may be defined only in a certain range (e.g. $t \in [0,100]$),
   but it is a compact range

- Discrete signal = function of a discrete variable
   - Signal has values only at certain discrete values (*samples*)
   - Indexed with natural numbers: $x[-1]$, $x[0]$, $x[1]$ etc.
   - Outside the samples, the signal is **not defined**

## Notation

- We use the following notation throughout these lectures

- Continuous signals
   - Has **round parantheses**, e.g. $x_a(t)$
   - Sometimes has the $a$ subscript
   - The variable is usually $t$ (time)
   - $x(2.3)$ = the value of the signal $a(t)$ at $t = 2.3$

- Discrete signals
   - Has **square brackets**, e.g. $x[n]$
   - The variables are denoted as $n$ or $k$ (suggest natural numbers)
   - $x[3]$ = the value of the signal $x[n]$ for $n = 3$
   - $x[1.5]$ = does not exist
