    "One of the prominent applications of convolution is in music/sound effects. As an example, consider an **echo** (or **reverberation** or **reverb** efect.\n",
    "\n",
    "In acoustics, an echo is similar to a system in the following way:\n",
    "- you emit an impulse, e.g. a short sound (this is the input impulse)\n",
    "- you receive back multiple reflections of you sound, with various delays and decaying amplitudes, as the signal is reflected and bounces back (this is the impulse response, i.e. the response of the system to your impulse)\n",

    "There are techniques to actually measure the **impulse response of a room** (a cathedral, a stadium etc), which characterizes the reverberation effect of that space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then one can transplant reverberation effect over a sound signal by preforming a convolution between the sound signal and the impulse reponse which characterizes that particular room or open space."
