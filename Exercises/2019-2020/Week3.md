FACUT WEEK 2
1. Characterize the following  systems with respect to:

    - Memory
    - Linearity
    - Time invariance
    - Causality
    - Stability

    a. $y[n] = n \cdot x[n^2]$
    a. $y[n] = x[n] \cdot cos(\omega_0 n)$
    a. $y[n] = sin(x[n])$
    a. $y[n] = x[n] + n \cdot x[n+1]$


2. Compute the convolution of the signals 
$x_1[n] = \{ ...,0,1,2,3,4,0,...\}$ and $x_2[n] = \{...,0,2,2,3,3,0,...\}$
