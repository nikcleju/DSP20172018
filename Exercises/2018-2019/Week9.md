1. A signal $x[n]$ has a Z transform with one pole $p_1 = -0.5$ and one zero $z_1 = 0.9$.
It is known that at $\omega = \pi$, the modulus of the Fourier transform is $|X(\omega=\pi)| = 1$.
    a. Find the signals's Z transform $X(z)$
    b. Find the values $|X(\frac{\pi}{2})|$, $|X(\frac{-\pi}{2})|$ and $|X(0)|$
    c. Compute the expression of $|X(\omega)|$ and $\angle X(\omega)$
    d. Sketch $|X(\omega)|$

2. Consider the following system: $y[n] = 0.8y[n-1] + \frac{1}{2}x[n] - \frac{1}{2}x[n-1]$.
What kind of filter is this?
    a. Low-pass filter
    b. Band-pass filter
    c. High-pass filter
    d. Band-stop filter
