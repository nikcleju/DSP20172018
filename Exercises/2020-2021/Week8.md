1. Compute the circular convolution of the two signals:
  $$x_1[n] = [1, 3, 1, 3]$$
  $$x_2[n] = [2, 2, 5, 5]$$

1. Compute the circular convolution in $N = 7$ points of the same two signals 
(i.e. append zeros to make length 7, then do circular convolution)

1. Find the DFT coefficients of the periodic signal with period $\{1, 1, 0, 0\}$,
and write the signal as a sum of sinusoidal components.

2. Find the DTFT of the signal $\{1, 1, 0, 0\}, considering it is surrounded with infinitely-long zeros on both sides
